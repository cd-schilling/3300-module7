                <p>
                    By examining review score distributions, we can identify patterns in high-rated and
                    low-rated games. This helps determine how much influence scores have on player
                    purchasing behavior.

                    critically acclaimed games tend to sell better, or if other factors, such as
                    marketing and brand reputation, play a larger role.
