                <p>
                    By examining review score distributions, we can identify patterns in high-rated and
                    low-rated games. This helps determine how much influence scores have on player
                    purchasing behavior.

                    Analyzing sales data alongside review scores allows us to assess whether
                    critically acclaimed games tend to sell better, or if other factors, such as
                    marketing and brand reputation, play a larger role.

                the industry's trends. While high review scores can positively influence sales, other 
                factors such as marketing strategies, brand loyalty, and game genre also play significant roles.
